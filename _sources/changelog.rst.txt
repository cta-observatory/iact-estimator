This is the changelog of *iact-estimator*.

Here you can find the what has changed since every release and a list
of the latest development changes.

Each version follows `Semantic Versioning`_ (``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``).

Backward incompatible (breaking) changes will only be introduced in minor
versions unitl v1.0.0 and in major
versions after that, in both cases with advance notice in the **Deprecations** section of releases.

===================================

Added
-----

- Added support for custom external performance data. (`#4 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/4>`__)
- Added EBL data from Dominguez et al. 2011. (`#5 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/5>`__)
- Added preliminary checks for observability and new plot to show an observability grid in time based on the specified constraints. (`#22 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/22>`__)
- Add support for plotting and saving images from the `SkyView <https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/titlepage.pl>`_ service. (`#25 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/25>`__)
- Added support for MAGIC+LST-1 performance estimation. (`#28 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/28>`__)
- Added support for plotting a skymap with the planned wobble pointings. (`#29 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/29>`__)
- Added configuration of the observer in order to estimate from more observatory sites other than just Roque de Los Muchachos. (`#35 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/35>`__)
- Allow to define a source also via its celestial coordinates. (`#36 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/36>`__)


Changed
-------

- Grouped all CLI into a single executable with subcommands.
  Also added an new configuration option to disable the plotting figures windows. (`#18 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/18>`__)


Fixed
-----

- Fixed a bug for whic if the target source is initialized using non-ICRS coordinates ``plot_skymap_with_wobbles`` would fail. (`#45 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/45>`__)
- Fixed a bug for which plot_transit will fail if target source coords are not in ICRS frame. (`#46 <https://github.com/cta-observatory/iact-estimator/issues/46>`__)
